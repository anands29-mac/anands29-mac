I'm Samridhi Anand and I'm a third-year Mechatronics Engineering student. With a keen interest in the intersection of technology and science, I've honed my skills in both fields and am driven by a passion for innovation. I'm also a Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, which demonstrates my strong leadership and project management abilities, showcasing my commitment to fostering learning and collaboration within the tech community. 
Additionally, I'm also a Community Team Lead at the Google Developer Students Club at McMaster University. I'm eager to apply my knowledge and enthusiasm to tackle exciting challenges and drive meaningful change in the tech and Engineering world.
